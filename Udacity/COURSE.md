### I.4. Program Structure

#### Program Structure
The Deep Learning Nanodegree program is divided into five parts, giving you a thorough understanding of deep learning, and covering some of the major topics.

#### Introduction
The first part is an introduction to the program as well as a couple lessons covering tools you'll be using. You'll also get a chance to apply some deep learning models to do cool things like transferring the style of artwork to another image.

We’ll start off with a simple introduction to linear regression and machine learning. This will give you the vocabulary you need to understand recent advancements, and make clear where deep learning fits into the broader picture of Machine Learning techniques.

#### Neural Networks
In this part, you'll learn how to build a simple neural network from scratch using python. We'll cover the algorithms used to train networks such as gradient descent and backpropagation.

The **first project** is also available this week. In this project, you'll predict bike ridership using a simple neural network.

You'll also learn about model evaluation and validation, an important technique for training and assessing neural networks. We also have guest instructor Andrew Trask, author of [Grokking Deep Learning](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-deep-learning), developing a neural network for processing text and predicting sentiment.

#### Convolutional Networks
Convolutional networks have achieved state of the art results in computer vision. These types of networks can detect and identify objects in images. You'll learn how to build convolutional networks in TensorFlow.

You'll also get the **second project**, where you'll build a convolutional network to classify dog breeds in pictures.

![convolutional-neural-networks](https://github.com/swoldetsadick/DeepLearning/blob/master/Udacity/Introductions/lesson-1/convolutional-neural-networks-2.jpg?raw=true)

You'll also use convolutional networks to build an autoencoder, a network architecture used for image compression and denoising. Then, you'll use a pretrained neural network ([VGGnet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.1556.pdf)), to classify images of flowers the network has never seen before, a technique known as transfer learning.

#### Recurrent Neural Networks
In this part, you’ll learn about Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) — a type of network architecture particularly well suited to data that forms sequences like text, music, and time series data. You'll build a recurrent neural network that can generate new text character by character.

![mn](https://github.com/swoldetsadick/DeepLearning/blob/master/Udacity/Introductions/lesson-1/rnn.png?raw=true)

Then, you'll learn about word embeddings and implement the [Word2Vec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word2vec) model, a network that can learn about semantic relationships between words. These are used to increase the efficiency of networks when you're processing text.

![wordembed](https://github.com/swoldetsadick/DeepLearning/blob/master/Udacity/Introductions/lesson-1/word-embeddings.jpg?raw=true)

You'll combine embeddings and an RNN to predict the sentiment of movie reviews, an example of common tasks in natural language processing.

In the **third project**, you'll use what you've learned here to generate new TV scripts from episodes of The Simpson's.

![encoderdecoder](https://github.com/swoldetsadick/DeepLearning/blob/master/Udacity/Introductions/lesson-1/sequence-to-sequence-unrolled-encoder-decoder.png?raw=true)

#### Generative Adversarial Networks
Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are one of the newest and most exciting deep learning architectures, showing incredible capacity for understanding real-world data. The networks can be used for generating images such as the [CycleGAN](https://github.com/junyanz/CycleGAN) project.

![examples](https://github.com/swoldetsadick/DeepLearning/blob/master/Udacity/Introductions/lesson-1/examples.jpg?raw=true)

The inventor of GANs, Ian Goodfellow, will show you how GANs work and how to implement them. You'll also learn about semi-supervised learning, a technique for training classifiers with data mostly missing labels.

In the **fourth project**, you'll use a deep convolutional GAN to generate completely new images of human faces.

![faces](https://github.com/swoldetsadick/DeepLearning/blob/master/Udacity/Introductions/lesson-1/faces.png?raw=true)

#### Deep Reinforcement Learning
Deep reinforcement learning has been in the center of some of the most recent advances in artificial intelligence. For example, it was widely used in the construction of AlphaGo by DeepMind.

In this section you'll use deep neural networks to design agents that can learn to take actions in a simulated environment. You'll then apply it to complex control tasks like video games and robotics.

![quadcopter](https://github.com/swoldetsadick/DeepLearning/blob/master/Udacity/Introductions/lesson-1/quadcopter.png?raw=true)

In the **fifth project**, you will design a Deep Reinforcement Learning agent to control several quadcopter flying tasks, including take-off, hover, and landing.

### I.5. Udacity Support

#### Getting Support
There are several ways in which you will receive support during the program from Udacity's network of Mentors and Reviewers, as well as your fellow students.

#### Knowledge
To ask questions and get answers from Udacity staff and your peers, we have the [Knowledge](https://knowledge.udacity.com/) platform. If you have ever used StackOverflow, this platform is similar. You can post new questions here, add answers or conversational comments, and **upvote** questions and answers. You can also **search** for existing answers and filter by Nanodegree program and project. Knowledge is accessible from the classroom as a lightbulb icon that you'll see at the bottom left of your navigation bar.

#### Study Groups
Using the Chat option, you will be able to get to know your fellow students, ask any questions you may have or answer other student's questions. All of the students in your Chat group are taking the same Nanodegree as you are, and will be familiar with your dilemmas.

In Udacity Study Groups, you'll have different rooms where you can talk to your fellow classmates, as well as Mentors for your class.

Your in-classroom Mentors will be your guide through the program and will do the following:

* Help you set learning goals.
* Guide you to supplementary resources when you get stuck.
* Respond to any questions you have about the program.

There are separate rooms for each project, which unlock as you progress through the program, as well as a room for general discussion.

To join Study Groups, click on the blue chat icon in the left hand menu when you are in the classroom. Then, agree to the Terms of Service. Lastly, join the 'My Classmates' channel to introduce yourself and meet your classmates.

### I.7. Pre-requisites

Prerequisites
We've designed this program such that you only require the following prerequisite knowledge:

* Required
- - [Intermediate Python experience](https://www.udacity.com/course/programming-foundations-with-python--ud036).

* Optional
- - [Multivariable Calculus](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus) and [Linear Algebra](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra) if possible.

That being said, we've included a lot of the detailed mathematics for those of you who do want to go in depth and understand the theory behind these concepts. Such content is optional and shouldn't prevent you from doing the projects. However, it is encouraged for a theoretical understanding.

### I.8. Deadline Policy

#### Deadline Policy
This program is project-based, and each project has a suggested deadline to keep students on pace towards graduation. In addition to the suggested project deadlines, you are expected to be in good standing with any requirements internal to your company, if you are sponsored by your employer, including any guidelines on enrollment end dates. To review all the projects order for this Nanodegree program, visit your Program Dashboard [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd101-ent/dashboard/overview).

#### Deadlines FAQ
**What is a “suggested deadline”?**
The “suggested deadlines” are flexible deadlines that are meant to guide students towards graduation and there’s no penalty if you miss the project deadlines we’ve laid out for you, as long as you complete all projects before your enrollment ends.

**Do I have to turn my projects in by the dates Udacity has laid out?**
No. The project deadline dates we’ve laid out are suggestions from our team to help keep you on pace to successfully graduate by the end of the Nanodegree term. The date that you should use as your compass is the enrollment end date determined by your start date.

**What happens if I don’t complete a project by the date Udacity has laid out?**
Nothing. **There is no penalty for missing a suggested project deadline and you can turn projects in at any time (before or after the suggested deadline), as long as it is by your enrollment end date**. Although the project deadlines you see are soft deadlines, we highly recommend you try your best to keep up with the suggested deadlines to ensure you can get through the content at a reasonable pace and so all your projects don’t pile up a few weeks before your enrollment ends.

**What do I need to do in order to complete the course?**
Students must complete and pass all the required projects by the **term-end date** in order to successfully graduate from the program. Passing a project means that a Udacity Reviewer has marked your project as “Meets Specifications.” The project review process can take anywhere between a couple of hours to a couple of days, so please plan accordingly as you turn in your projects towards the end of your term. Your projects must be reviewed and passed by the last day of the term. NOTE: you can submit your project as many times as you need to in order to pass.

**Can I graduate from the Nanodegree program without completing and passing all the required projects?**
No, all required projects must be completed and passed in order to receive a Nandodegree program certificate. However, the course may have a few extra projects or labs (those not mentioned in the Deadlines calendar), which are solely for your benefit and are not required for graduation.

**Do I need to wait until the last day of the term in order to graduate?**
No. Students can graduate from the program at anytime after they complete and pass all the required projects. Once your final project has been passed by a Udacity Reviewer, you will see the option to begin the graduation process.

**What happens if I don’t turn all my projects and my enrollment ends?**
You may either:

* Reach out to your Program Manager within your company, if you have one assigned to you.
* You may submit a question about options to request an extension via Udacity's Help Desk
