### I.4. Program Structure

#### Program Structure
The Deep Learning Nanodegree program is divided into five parts, giving you a thorough understanding of deep learning, and covering some of the major topics.

#### Introduction
The first part is an introduction to the program as well as a couple lessons covering tools you'll be using. You'll also get a chance to apply some deep learning models to do cool things like transferring the style of artwork to another image.

We’ll start off with a simple introduction to linear regression and machine learning. This will give you the vocabulary you need to understand recent advancements, and make clear where deep learning fits into the broader picture of Machine Learning techniques.

#### Neural Networks
In this part, you'll learn how to build a simple neural network from scratch using python. We'll cover the algorithms used to train networks such as gradient descent and backpropagation.

The **first project** is also available this week. In this project, you'll predict bike ridership using a simple neural network.

You'll also learn about model evaluation and validation, an important technique for training and assessing neural networks. We also have guest instructor Andrew Trask, author of [Grokking Deep Learning](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-deep-learning), developing a neural network for processing text and predicting sentiment.

#### Convolutional Networks
Convolutional networks have achieved state of the art results in computer vision. These types of networks can detect and identify objects in images. You'll learn how to build convolutional networks in TensorFlow.

You'll also get the **second project**, where you'll build a convolutional network to classify dog breeds in pictures.

![convolutional-neural-networks](https://github.com/swoldetsadick/DeepLearning/blob/master/Udacity/Introductions/lesson-1/convolutional-neural-networks-2.jpg?raw=true)

You'll also use convolutional networks to build an autoencoder, a network architecture used for image compression and denoising. Then, you'll use a pretrained neural network ([VGGnet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.1556.pdf)), to classify images of flowers the network has never seen before, a technique known as transfer learning.

#### Recurrent Neural Networks
In this part, you’ll learn about Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) — a type of network architecture particularly well suited to data that forms sequences like text, music, and time series data. You'll build a recurrent neural network that can generate new text character by character.

Then, you'll learn about word embeddings and implement the [Word2Vec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word2vec) model, a network that can learn about semantic relationships between words. These are used to increase the efficiency of networks when you're processing text.

![wordembed](https://github.com/swoldetsadick/DeepLearning/blob/master/Udacity/Introductions/lesson-1/word-embeddings.jpg?raw=true)

You'll combine embeddings and an RNN to predict the sentiment of movie reviews, an example of common tasks in natural language processing.

In the **third project**, you'll use what you've learned here to generate new TV scripts from episodes of The Simpson's.

#### Generative Adversarial Networks
Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are one of the newest and most exciting deep learning architectures, showing incredible capacity for understanding real-world data. The networks can be used for generating images such as the [CycleGAN](https://github.com/junyanz/CycleGAN) project.

![examples](https://github.com/swoldetsadick/DeepLearning/blob/master/Udacity/Introductions/lesson-1/examples.jpg?raw=true)

The inventor of GANs, Ian Goodfellow, will show you how GANs work and how to implement them. You'll also learn about semi-supervised learning, a technique for training classifiers with data mostly missing labels.

In the **fourth project**, you'll use a deep convolutional GAN to generate completely new images of human faces.

#### Deep Reinforcement Learning
Deep reinforcement learning has been in the center of some of the most recent advances in artificial intelligence. For example, it was widely used in the construction of AlphaGo by DeepMind.

In this section you'll use deep neural networks to design agents that can learn to take actions in a simulated environment. You'll then apply it to complex control tasks like video games and robotics.

![quadcopter](https://github.com/swoldetsadick/DeepLearning/blob/master/Udacity/Introductions/lesson-1/quadcopter.png?raw=true)

In the **fifth project**, you will design a Deep Reinforcement Learning agent to control several quadcopter flying tasks, including take-off, hover, and landing.

### I.5. Udacity Support

#### Getting Support
There are several ways in which you will receive support during the program from Udacity's network of Mentors and Reviewers, as well as your fellow students.

#### Knowledge
To ask questions and get answers from Udacity staff and your peers, we have the [Knowledge](https://knowledge.udacity.com/) platform. If you have ever used StackOverflow, this platform is similar. You can post new questions here, add answers or conversational comments, and **upvote** questions and answers. You can also **search** for existing answers and filter by Nanodegree program and project. Knowledge is accessible from the classroom as a lightbulb icon that you'll see at the bottom left of your navigation bar.

#### Study Groups
Using the Chat option, you will be able to get to know your fellow students, ask any questions you may have or answer other student's questions. All of the students in your Chat group are taking the same Nanodegree as you are, and will be familiar with your dilemmas.

In Udacity Study Groups, you'll have different rooms where you can talk to your fellow classmates, as well as Mentors for your class.

Your in-classroom Mentors will be your guide through the program and will do the following:

* Help you set learning goals.
* Guide you to supplementary resources when you get stuck.
* Respond to any questions you have about the program.

There are separate rooms for each project, which unlock as you progress through the program, as well as a room for general discussion.

To join Study Groups, click on the blue chat icon in the left hand menu when you are in the classroom. Then, agree to the Terms of Service. Lastly, join the 'My Classmates' channel to introduce yourself and meet your classmates.

#### Reviews
For each project you submit, you will receive detailed feedback from a project Reviewer.

Sometimes, a reviewer might ask you to resubmit a project to meet specifications. In that case, an indication of needed changes will also be provided. Note that you can submit a project as many times as needed to pass.
